# Orrery
Code for Orrery simulation on Adafruit devices


Three versions of a simple four planet Orrery:

* orrery.js - Javascript/Makecode version for the Circuit Playground

* orrery.py - Circuit Python version for the Circuit Playground

* neo-orrery.py - Circuit Python version for the NeoTrinkey

All versions start by showing Mercury (pale white), Venus (yellow), Earth (green) and Mars (red) as neo pixels moving at their relative speeds around the sun - from Mercury the fastest to Mars the slowest.

Each can switch to a random setting, changing the color and speeds of the four planets.

Makecode version: "A" stops/starts motion, "B" sets up a random solar system, and "Shake" resets to defaults.

Circuit Python Playground version: "B" sets up a random solar system and "A" resets to defaults

Circuit Python NeoTrinkey version: Touch pad #2 to get a random solar system and pad #1 to reset to defaults.
